Fun With λ-Calculus Documentation
=================================

Greeting, fellow logician!

Fun with λ-calculus (fwlc for short) is an evaluator and explorator for untyped
Lambda Calculus.

As an interpretor, fwlc can evaluate lambda expression, that is:

- perform β-reduction.
- perform η-reduction (not yet in fact).

As an explorator, fwlc is able to give the user some meta-informations about a
lambda expression. Here is a short list of the possibilities:

- test whether a lambda expression is in its β-normal form.
- give the set of free variables in a given lambda expression.
- test for the β-equivalence of two given lambda expressions (not yet in fact). 
- test for the α-equivalence of two given lambda expressions (not yet in fact).
